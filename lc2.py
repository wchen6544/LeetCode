        Explanation:

            This is a memorization question so you have to keep track of everything before during your for loops
            
            coins = [1,2,3]
            amount = 10

            To make a 1 you need 1 coin, to make a 2 you need 1 coin, to make a 3 you need 1 coin

            TO make a 4 you need to look through all of your COINS and you see that you can make a 4 with either a (2 and 2) or
            a (1 and 3). BOTH require 2 coins so its {4: 2}

            Make sure you add the (if i not in m) in your code b/c you are getting the smallest amount of coins so you need a 
            starting value as your "biggest".

            Finally you add a (if amount in m) to check if it is possible to make the amount given the coin list. If it is impossible
            then you return -1

        Explanation:

            You want to loop backwards starting from 4 going all the way back to 3. Our ending number is going to be the

            index of the last number which is 5. We check if the number at the current index of the for loop plus its index

            is greater or equal to the ending number

            Example:

                2 + 3 (index of 2) = 5 which is greater than 4.

            If the ending number is 0 then we can return True because it means that we are able to get from the last index

            to the first index.

        Steps:

            Loop 0
                ending = 5

            Loop 1
                i = 5
                4 + 5 >= 5
                ending = 5

            Loop 2
                i = 4
                0 + 4 >= 5 (nope)

            Loop 3
                i = 3
                3 + 2 >= 5
                ending = 3

            Loop 4
                i = 2
                1 + 2 >= 3
                ending = 2

            Loop 5

                1 + 1 >= 2
